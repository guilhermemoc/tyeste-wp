# personal-boilerplate
Base components for work i do day-in-day.


This has a blank package.json for filling with basic information and setting your own Git repo. Also some npm modules i use for
with Stylus and Gulp. There's a Media query combiner for nesting.

Header has OG tags, is already linked to the main.css that will be generated if you execute Gulp.

Also includes some common vendors that i use in most projects. Mainly Jquery, Parallax.js, Slick Carousel and HTMLshiv. 

They are all in the same document for less calls and are already linked in the footer include, also there is a call for a main.js file on
the scripts folder.

Bye.
